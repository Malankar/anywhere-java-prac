#### **`What are asynchronous operation in java `**
```
Asynchronous operations in Java are operations that are executed in a separate thread from the calling thread, allowing the calling thread to continue executing while the asynchronous operation is being performed.

Asynchronous operations are typically used to perform long-running or blocking tasks, such as I/O operations or network requests, without blocking the calling thread. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of an application by allowing it to do other work while waiting for the result of the asynchronous operation.

In Java, asynchronous operations are typically implemented using the Future and CompletableFuture interfaces, which provide methods to track the status of an asynchronous operation and to obtain its result when it is ready.

#### **`What are Future and CompletableFuture`**
```
Future and CompletableFuture are interfaces in the Java standard library that are used to manage asynchronous computations. They provide methods to track the status of an asynchronous operation and to obtain its result when it is ready.
