#### **`What are asynchronous operation in java `**
```
Asynchronous operations in Java are operations that are executed in a separate thread from the calling thread, allowing the calling thread to continue executing while the asynchronous operation is being performed.

Asynchronous operations are typically used to perform long-running or blocking tasks, such as I/O operations or network requests, without blocking the calling thread. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of an application by allowing it to do other work while waiting for the result of the asynchronous operation.

In Java, asynchronous operations are typically implemented using the Future and CompletableFuture interfaces, which provide methods to track the status of an asynchronous operation and to obtain its result when it is ready.
```

#### **`What are Future and CompletableFuture`**
```
Future and CompletableFuture are interfaces in the Java standard library that are used to manage asynchronous computations. They provide methods to track the status of an asynchronous operation and to obtain its result when it is ready.

A Future is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in the future. Futures are used to allow a program to continue executing other tasks while it is waiting for the result of an asynchronous operation.

A CompletableFuture is a specific type of Future that allows the result of the asynchronous operation to be set or completed manually. This means that you can use a CompletableFuture to represent the result of an operation that you want to start and complete at some later time.
```

#### **`What is callable?`**
```
Callable and Runnable are two interfaces used to represent task that can be run concurrently.

The ExecutorService is an interface that represents an asynchronous execution facility. It can be used to manage a thread pool and execute tasks asynchronously by starting a new thread or assigning the task to an existing thread in the pool.

The Callable interface is specifically designed to allow the task to return a result and throw a checked exception, and the Future class is used to represent the result of the task and provide methods for retrieving the result and waiting for the task to complete.

So in contrast to using runnable the main thread can use the Future object to retrieve the result of the task or wait for it to complete if necessary.
```

#### **`How do I create a completable future in Java?`**
```
Using the CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() static method: This method takes a Supplier (a function that returns a value) and returns a CompletableFuture that will be completed with the result of the supplier when it is available.

Using the CompletableFuture.runAsync() static method: This method takes a Runnable (a task that does not return a value) and returns a CompletableFuture that will be completed when the runnable finishes executing.

Using the CompletableFuture.completedFuture() static method: This method takes a value and returns a CompletableFuture that is already completed with that value.

Using the CompletableFuture.completedExceptionally() static method: This method takes an exception and returns a CompletableFuture that is already completed with that exception.
```

#### **`How do I access the result of a completable future?`**

```
get(): This method blocks the current thread until the result is available, and then returns the result.

join(): This method blocks the current thread until the result is available, and then returns the result. It is similar to get(), but it does not throw any checked exceptions.

thenApply(): This method takes a function that is applied to the result of the future when it is available, and returns a new completable future that is completed with the result of the function.
```

#### **`How do I chain completable futures?`**

```
To chain completable futures, you can use one of the "then" methods provided by the CompletableFuture class. These methods allow you to specify a task that should be executed when the future is completed, and return a new completable future that is completed with the result of the task.

thenApply(): This method takes a function that is applied to the result of the future when it is available, and returns a new completable future that is completed with the result of the function.

thenAccept(): This method takes a consumer that is called with the result of the future when it is available, and returns a new completable future that is completed with the same result as the original future.

thenRun(): This method takes a runnable that is executed when the result of the future is available, and returns a new completable future that is completed with the same result as the original future.
```

#### **`How do I handle exceptions in completable futures?`**
```
exceptionally(): This method takes a function that is called with the exception thrown by the future, and returns a new completable future that is completed with the result of the function.
```

#### **`How do I wait for multiple completable futures to complete?`**
```
To wait for multiple completable futures to complete, you can use the allOf() static method of the CompletableFuture class. This method takes an array of completable futures and returns a new completable future that is completed when all of the input futures are completed.

You can also use the anyOf() static method, which takes an array of completable futures and returns a new completable future that is completed when any of the input futures are completed.
```

#### **`How do I create a completable future?`**
```
In Java, you can create a completable future using the CompletableFuture class. There are several static methods that you can use to create a completable future:
Copy code
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello, World!");
This creates a completable future that will be completed with the value "Hello, World!" when it becomes available.
```

#### **`How do I complete a completable future?`**
```
You can complete a completable future by calling its complete or completeExceptionally methods. For example:
```
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
future.complete("Hello, World!");
```
```
This will complete the future with the value "Hello, World!". You can also complete a future exceptionally by providing an exception:
```
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
future.completeExceptionally(new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!"));
```


#### **`How do I handle the result of a completable future?`**
```
You can handle the result of a completable future using its thenApply, thenAccept, or thenRun methods. For example:
```
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello, World!");
future.thenApply(s -> s.toUpperCase())
      .thenAccept(s -> System.out.println(s));
```
```
This will print "HELLO, WORLD!" to the console when the future is completed.
```

#### **`How do I chain completable futures?`**
```
You can chain completable futures using the thenCompose or thenCombine methods. For example:
```
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> ", World!");

CompletableFuture<String> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2);
```
```
This will create a new completable future that is completed with the concatenation of the values from future1 and future2 when both futures are completed.
```

#### **`How do I handle exceptions in completable futures?`**
```
You can handle exceptions in completable futures using the exceptionally method. For example:
```
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
  throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!");
});

future.exceptionally(ex -> "Error: " + ex.getMessage())
      .thenAccept(s -> System.out.println(s));
```
```
This will print "Error: Something went wrong!" to the console if the future is completed exceptionally with a RuntimeException.
```

#### **`Can I combine multiple completable futures?`**
```
Yes, you can combine multiple completable futures using the allOf and anyOf methods.
The allOf method creates a new completable future that is completed when all of the provided futures are completed.

The anyOf method creates a new completable future that is completed when any of the provided futures are completed.
```
