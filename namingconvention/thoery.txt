What is naming convention?
Java naming convention is a convention to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc. 

Class & Interface- Pascal Case Eg. PascalClass 
Method & Varaibles - Camel Case Eg. camelCase  
Package - lowercase 
Constant - UPPERCASE seperated by underscores.

Tips:
class - noun - ReverseString, Add2Numbers etc.
interface - adjective 
method - verb - running, walking etc.
