#### **`What is Arraylist?`**
```
An ArrayList is a data structure in Java that is used to store a list of objects. It is similar to an array, but it can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. This makes it an ideal data structure for storing a collection of objects.
```

#### **`How the ArrayList works?`**
```
The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.
```

#### **`Why use it?`**
```
Arraylist is to provide an efficient way to store and access data, as well as to easily add and remove items from the collection. Arraylists are commonly used in programming because they allow for fast and convenient access to data, and they are able to dynamically resize themselves to accommodate new items as needed.
```

#### **`Usecase?`**
```
Suppose we are building a game and we want to store the options a player chooses on every level and based on that outcomes of the later game will change we can store this choosen options in an Arraylist for better accessiblity.
```

#### **`Another usecase`**
```
use case for an arraylist would be to store a list of items that need to be accessed frequently, such as a list of user accounts or a list of product names. In this case, an arraylist would be an efficient way to store and access the data because it allows for fast lookup and easy manipulation of the items in the list.
```


#### **`Why its not efficient for larger data sets?`**

```
When an arraylist needs to resize its array, it must allocate a new, larger array in memory and copy all of the items from the old array to the new array. This can be a time-consuming process, and it can also lead to higher memory usage because the arraylist now has two arrays in memory: the old array and the new array. This can make an arraylist less efficient for accessing data and using memory compared to other data structures.
```

#### **`Disadvantage of Arraylist?`**
```
One of the main disadvantages of an arraylist is that it is not as efficient for accessing data as some other data structures. This is because an arraylist uses a dynamic array to store its data, which can lead to slower access times and higher memory usage compared to other data structures. 
```

#### **`Keypoint`**
```
Fast lookup and easy manipulation. 
Slow access times and higher memory consumption on large data.
