Why do we need multi threading?
Imagine a stockbroker application with lots of complex capabilities.These are few of its functions:
To download the last stock option prices
To check prices for warnings
Analyze historical data for any company.

These are time-consuming functions. In a single-threaded runtime environment, these actions execute one after another. The next action can happen only when the previous one is finished.
Now, if a historical analysis takes half an hour, and the user selects to perform a download and check afterward, the warning may come too late to, buy or sell stock as a result. Ideally, the download should happen in the background (that is, in another thread). That way, other processes could happen at the same time so that, for example, a warning could be communicated instantly. All the while, the user is interacting with other parts of the application. The analysis, too, could happen in a separate thread, so the user can work with the rest of the application while the results are being calculated.


What are Threads ?
A thread is a lightweight process. It is created and controlled using the Thread class. 
A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called thread and each thread defines a separate path of execution. 


Thread lifecycle?
A thread can lie only in one of the shown states at any point of time.
New - When thread is created 
Runnable - Once create we start it.
Running - In this thread is executing run method.
Waiting - When thread is inactive 
Terminated - When its completes its terminated.


Where its used?
When we have long running operation we use thread. We shouldn't burden the main thread instead create various thread to manage the task. 


Usecase ?
for downloading an image we can use thread. 

Create a thread?
By implementing the Runnable interface.
By extending the Thread

Difference between Thread Class and Runnable interface?
A class extending Thread cannot extend anything else. With Runnable class can implement other interfaces
Thread is extended when we want to overrider other methods Runnable is used for overriding run method only. Thread has tight coupling and Runnable has loose coupling means 


Multithreading in Java ?
Multi threading is the ability of a program to run two or more threads concurrently, where each thread can handle a different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources.

Synchronization?
If Multiple Threads are going to work on the same single object we must Synchronize them on after other this is known as Synchronization. Or else the method will run asynchronously.

Locks in Java? 
Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock or monitor. Each and every object has a lock associated with it. So a thread that needs consistent access to an object’s fields needs to acquire the object’s lock before accessing them, and then release the lock when the work is done.

When we need it?
We need in multithreading when multiple threads are working on the same single object. 

Thread pool?
Java thread pool manages the pool of worker threads and contains a queue that keep the tasks waiting to get executed.
