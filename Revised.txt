How much memory is allocated when an object is created in Java?
The heap memory used by a Java object includes memory for reference fields (4 bytes each);

Is JVM present in all the machine? Is JDK, JRE and JVM platform independent?
No, JVM does not come with OS, you need to download JRE or JDK. Java is platform independent but JVM/JRE/JDK are highly platform dependent. In fact JVM/JRE being platform dependent is what makes java platform independent. As it is responsibility of JVM to convert platform independent bytecote to platform dependent/ machine understandable code.
