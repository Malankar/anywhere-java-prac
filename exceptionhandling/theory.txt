What is an Exception?
An exception is generally an unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of your program. Exception are thrown only at runtime and not at compile time.
Eg. When we parseInt a string without a number it gives us a NumberFormatException

What is difference between exception and error?


What if we dont handle the exception?
The program just terminates and throws an exception. So inorder to keep our program running we should handle this exception which can be done by try and catch block. 

Why would we need a finally block?
Suppose you are making a database call and either it fails or succeds you want to close the database connection we can do that using the finally block.
