What is an Exception?
An exception is generally an unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of your program. 
It can occur for various reasons say-
A user has entered an invalid data
File not found
A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications
The JVM has run out of a memory
etc.

What is Exceptions Hierarchy ?
All exception and error types are subclasses of class Throwable, which is the base class of hierarchy. One branch is headed by Error which occurs at run-time and other by Exception that can happen either at compile time or run-time.

What is difference between exception and error?
Error is used by the Java run-time system (JVM) to indicate errors that are associated with the run-time environment (JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error. Whereas Exception is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception.

Types of Exception?
We have two types of exception Checked and Unchecked.
Checked Exception
A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions.
For example, if you use FileReader class in your program to read data from a file, if the file specified in its constructor doesn't exist, then a FileNotFoundException occurs, and the compiler prompts the programmer to handle the exception.

Unchecked Exception
An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.
For example, if you have declared an array of size 5 in your program, and trying to call the 6th element of the array then an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionexception occurs.


What if we dont handle the exception?
When an exception occurs, and if you donâ€™t handle it, the program will terminate abruptly.

How to handle exceptions in Java?  
We can use try catch blocks or throw and throws keywords for handling the exceptions.

Why would we need a finally block?
Suppose you are making a database call and either it fails or succeds you want to close the database connection we can do that using the finally block.


Throw and Throws in java?
throw keyword is used to throw an exception object. We create a new object of the Exception class for which we want to throw the exception. 
Throws keyword is used to declare an exception as well as bypass the caller. It throws the exception so it can be handle by the method which is calling this method.
