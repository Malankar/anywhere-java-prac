What are access modifiers?
Access modifiers are keywords that regulate access to different parts of our code.
It determines till where you code will be accessible by other classes means inside a class or inside the package and so on.
Java has four access modifiers they are as follows 
Private, Default, Protected and Public 

Why are access modifiers used?
Consider me as an object of Children class so some of my belonging are used by me only no one else can use them eg my shirt or trouser but if I own a car it can be used or accessed by my relative, family members or friends. Similar to how you set a level of access to your possessions, Java controls access, too. You want to define the access level for variables, methods, and classes, depending on which other classes you want accessing them.

Private 
Private is the most restrictive access modifier. It limits the visibility of data and methods to within a single class. 
Eg. Take a cat class it has variables like name, age and weight. If these variables are made public then any instance of the class in any class can change them. Suppose a new programmer comes in and changes the cat age to 50 that would cause bugs in the program. Inorder to prevent this we can make the variables private and then access them using getters and setters. Getters and setters give more control over our variables like making change while conditions are true or throwing an error instead.
Eg. 2: When we want to fetch data from an api so the api data will be json and we have to convert it into a string format and then store in an array. To achieve this we will write several methods in our class file like getData to get the data which calls a connection to the api then another function to convert these data into string format and store  it an array and give back to us. So while performing this whole process if we just create helper methods to be public they can be accessible by the objects instance and the new programmer would be confused what he has to use. So inorder to prevent that we can make the helper methods private and make the getData method only default or public so that the complexity of how the data is delivered to certain classes will not be taken into consideration.

Protected
Fields and methods marked by the protected access modifier will be visible:
within all classes included in the same package as ours;
within all classes that inherit our class.
