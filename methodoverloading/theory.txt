What is Method overloading?
In Java, two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters. These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading.

Use cases of method overloading?
Suppose there is a method to show user data with specific input 
show() -  this shows all the users data
show(user)- This shows specific users data
show(dob)-This shows data of all the user who were born on the specific dob. 
etc.
We can also use this for constructors.
