#### **`What are Servlet ?`**
```
Servlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the webserver. 

Servlets are used to create dynamic web content and handle client requests. They run on the server side, and can be used to process form data, authenticate users, track sessions, and much more.

#### **`Advantages of a Java Servlet ?`**
```
Servlet is faster than CGI as it doesnâ€™t involve the creation of a new process for every new request received.
Servlets, as written in Java, are platform-independent.
It is a server-side component, so Servlet inherits the security provided by the Web server.
```
#### **`Servlet Container?`**
```
Servlet container, also known as Servlet engine is an integrated set of objects that provide a run time environment for Java Servlet components. 
In simple words, it is a system that manages Java Servlet components on top of the Web server to handle the Web client requests. 
```

#### **`Servlet lifecycle`**
```
A servlet is a Java class that is designed to extend the capabilities of a server. It runs on the server side and is used to handle client requests and generate responses.

The servlet lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occurs when a servlet is created, initialized, and destroyed. Here is an overview of the servlet lifecycle:

Class loading: The servlet class is loaded into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when the web application is deployed or started.

Instantiation: The servlet class is instantiated, creating a new instance of the servlet.

Initialization: The servlet's init() method is called, allowing the servlet to initialize itself and perform any necessary setup. The init() method is called when the servlet is first created.

Request handling: The servlet handles client requests by calling its service() method and generating a response.

Destruction: When the web application is undeployed or stopped, the servlet's destroy() method is called, allowing the servlet to release any resources and perform any necessary cleanup.
